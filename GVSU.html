                            <h3>GRAND RAPIDS, MI – The Grand Valley State University (GVSU) Board of Trustees has approved a $166 million plan to build its new Blue Dot technology hub.</h3>
                            <p>To cover the cost, the university authorized issuing bonds not to exceed $139 million, a decision applauded by GVSU leaders and decried by some faculty members.The bonds will cover the $101.4 million renovation of the 10-story L.V. Eberhard Center in downtown Grand Rapids, along with a new, $64.6 million building addition that will become the Blue Dot Lab. Plans for both projects were also approved during the Friday board meeting.</p>
                            <p>He expressed confidence in the university’s ability to take on the debt without issue.

The university now has just over $184 million in outstanding debt, Sanial said, with around $166 million of that in existing bonds.

After an estimated $14.6 million payment during the 2025-26 school year, the estimated debt remaining will be just over $170 million.

Sanial said GVSU’s “high-water mark” for total bond debt was just over $260 million in 2020.

“Our bond debt, when we do this borrowing, will be at a similar level,” he said.

Sanial said the university rapidly pays off its debt and will see existing costs related to repayment begin to decline in 2031.

The final maturity date of the new bonds is set no later than Dec. 31, 2058.

Hall said there have been some “informal concerns” shared with the board by community members who learned about the project plan and its associated cost.

For faculty members like Professor Andrew Spear, the bond authorization represents a significant decision that was made without properly consulting the campus community.

Spear, who’s been teaching at GVSU since 2008 and has chaired the philosophy department since 2023, said the request came as “quite a shock” for some faculty members.

He learned about the proposal a week ago, just a single day before the deadline to sign up for public comment at the next board meeting.

The request is somewhere around $60 or $70 million more than he anticipated the university would spend.

Amy McFarland, director and associate professor of environmental and sustainability studies, said it is “highly unethical and immoral and financially unwise for the institution and for our students.”</p>
                            <p>In response to faculty concerns, Assistant Vice President of University Communications Chris Knape said the Blue Dot Lab plan has been developed during “years of discussions that began almost 10 years ago,” and has long been part of the university’s master plan.

He said planning for the lab “continues to involve a multidisciplinary group of faculty, students and staff members working alongside our facilities and leadership teams.”

GVSU has shown a recent interest in expanding its tech offerings to keep up with a growing reliance on things like artificial intelligence. New AI degree programs were announced last year.

University leaders presented the Blue Dot Lab project as the next investment in students, also enabling new community opportunities.

Karen Ingle, associate vice president for facilities planning, described it as a “technology-rich innovation center” with spaces for education, applied research and university enterprises.

The goal is to expand the number of graduates with deep technical computing, data and AI knowledge, she said.

When it comes to GVSU’s financial situation, President Philomena Mantella said during a university address last fall that despite a period of higher-education financial uncertainty, GVSU is uniquely positioned to weather the storm, due to the university’s size and funding model.</p>

                            <p>Multiple high-ranking leaders, like Mantella, have received raises in recent years, and enrollment is up in 2025-26 from the academic year prior.

But at the same time, the university has recently lobbied for more state funding, releasing an economic report in October of last year that pointed at $3 billion in annual economic impact across the state.

And for the 2025-26 academic year, GVSU raised its tuition prices by 4.7%, the latest in a series of increases bumping up tuition fees by an average of $734 per year.

McFarland expressed concern that the bonds could further drive up student tuition costs, a sentiment that was shared by Brian Deyo, an associate professor of English at GVSU.

“These are tough times across the board for higher education in the United States,” he said. “If you are going to go into that much debt … this is doubling our debt burden … inevitably it’s going to drive up the price of tuition for students.”

Deyo said it seems unfair that faculty and students haven’t been brought fully into the fold when a majority of GVSU’s operating budget comes from student tuition dollars.

“Do students want this?” he asked. “Do they need this? Do students want AI? Are students worried about the climate implications of the building of data centers that support AI?

“They’re seeing their futures foreclosed,” Deyo said.

During the meeting, Hall said there’s a “very careful plan to make sure that the university is not taking more debt than it can manage, and there is a history of the university successfully doing just that.”

In addition to the bond dollars, GVSU is set to receive $30 million from the state for the project, contingent on the Legislature also signing off on the proposal.

The $166 million project has been split into two segments and each was approved by the board separately, which GVSU leaders explained was to better position the plan to receive state funding. The projects will result in one large building.

A renovation of the L.V. Eberhard Center, a 160,203-square-foot academic building at 301 West Fulton Street in downtown Grand Rapids, is the more expensive of the two project segments at a cost of $101.4 million.

The second portion of the project is the addition of a four-story, 58,247-square-foot Blue Dot Lab adjoining the Eberhard Center, at a cost of $64.6 million.

After the Feb. 6 board approval of the project plans, the goal is to begin construction this May and complete it in August 2028.</p>
                            <p>
In addition to the bond cost, several faculty members also expressed concern about the scope of the Blue Dot project on the whole, and how it could benefit – or leave out – portions of the campus community.

“Budgets are moral documents that reflect the values and spending priorities of colleges and universities,” Deyo said, expressing concern that the concentrated tech investment leaves out the humanities that helped shape GVSU’s identity as a public regional liberal arts university.

Spear pointed out that money spent on one thing then isn’t spent on another.

“Times are tough for dreamers, right? You’re talking to dreamers here,” he said, gesturing to himself and several other humanities professors who spoke with MLive/The Grand Rapids Press. “But what we do with money says something about the values we have and what we value most.”

The other primary worry is that most people at the university don’t quite appreciate exactly what Blue Dot is supposed to be, he said.

“If you’re going to invest this much, what is it we’re doing?” Spear asked.

He said it appears that the benefit will be primarily to computing and tech students and faculty, “and for everyone else, it’s nothing.”

“If we’re going to borrow up to half the cost of our annual budget, just for one small section of the university, is it really worth it?”

Chris Cirefice, assistant coordinator at GVSU’s Language Resource Center, said he was recently asked by a university dean if he envisioned students primarily located on the Allendale campus being able to use the new Grand Rapids tech hub.

“Our response to that was, we see a very slim chance that our students in languages, humanities, CLAS (College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) disciplines ... are able to make it,” he said, describing a 30-to-45 minute commute one way for an hour-long class.

Cirefice called the idea of equitable use “a little bit idealistic.”

“A lot of the communications about Blue Dot have been specifically around this idea and concept of an ecosystem,” he said. “Blue Dot is a part of that ecosystem downtown, primarily focused on tech and business. What are we doing for the other disciplines, majors, programs, and services on our other campuses?”

In response, Knape said “as discussed at today’s Board of Trustees meeting, the lab and the renovated L.V. Eberhard Center will include facilities that will enhance digital literacy and career opportunities for all students at the university.”

“We are proud to deepen our investment in the City Campus in downtown Grand Rapids,” he said. ”And we continue to make significant investments at our Valley Campus in Allendale. The City and Valley campuses are part of what makes GVSU such a unique higher education experience."

Cirefice, who said he studied technology and computer science along with French and linguistics, expressed concern about the potential for overinvestment in tech.</p>
                                <p>“Lots of tech people don’t have the soft skills and the critical thinking … to actually work effectively in the tech industry in the first place,” he said.

Spear said technology can be a tool.

“But I think there’s great campus concern about the concept of Blue Dot effectively acting as a monolith downtown for a subset of our population, where those resources being put toward that monolith are not being redistributed elsewhere.”

He said moving forward, GVSU faculty need to decide “what they’re really concerned about and what they really value here.”

“The faculty, through its governance and perhaps also through grassroots efforts, needs to speak with a clearer voice,” he said.</p>
